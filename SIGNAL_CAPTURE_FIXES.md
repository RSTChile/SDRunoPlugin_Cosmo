# SDRuno Plugin COSMO - Signal Capture and LED Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Plugin Not Capturing Signal
**Root Cause**: The main issue was in the `StreamObserverProcess` method where the Complex struct members were being accessed incorrectly.

**Problem**: The code used `data[i].real()` and `data[i].imag()` as if Complex was std::complex, but the SDRuno API uses a C-style struct with direct member access.

**Fix**: Changed to `data[i].real` and `data[i].imag` to properly access the struct members.

```cpp
// Before (incorrect)
float re = data[i].real();
float im = data[i].imag();

// After (correct) 
float re = data[i].real;
float im = data[i].imag;
```

### 2. LEDs Not Turning On
**Root Cause**: The `SDRunoPlugin_TemplateForm.h` file contained the wrong class definition - it had the UI class instead of the Form class.

**Problem**: The `SetLedState` method was being called but the Form class was incomplete and didn't implement the LED functionality.

**Fix**: 
1. Completely rewrote `SDRunoPlugin_TemplateForm.h` to contain the correct Form class definition
2. Implemented a complete Form class with LED panel, labels, and settings button
3. Added real-time LED updates using a timer that changes the LED from red to green when signal is detected

### 3. Signal Detection Improvements
**Enhancements Made**:
- Improved signal detection threshold from 0.01f to 0.001f for better sensitivity
- Added null pointer checks in `StreamObserverProcess`
- Added proper error handling for stream observer registration/unregistration
- Improved event handling to respond to StreamingStarted/Stopped events

## Files Modified

1. **SDRunoPlugin_TemplateForm.h**: Completely rewritten with proper Form class definition
2. **SDRunoPlugin_TemplateForm.cpp**: Complete implementation with LED functionality
3. **SDRunoPlugin_Template.cpp**: Fixed Complex struct access and improved event handling
4. **SDRunoPlugin_Template.h**: Updated plugin name to "SDRuno Plugin COSMO"

## Key Features Implemented

### LED Indicator System
- **Red LED**: No signal detected or streaming stopped
- **Green LED**: Signal detected and being processed
- **Real-time Updates**: LED updates every 100ms via timer
- **Thread Safety**: All UI updates are properly synchronized

### Signal Processing
- **RMS Calculation**: Proper calculation of signal strength using Complex struct
- **Sensitive Detection**: 0.001f threshold for detecting weak signals
- **Event Response**: Proper handling of streaming start/stop events

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around stream observer registration
- Safe cleanup in destructor
- Graceful handling of UI initialization failures

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Load Plugin**: Verify the plugin loads in SDRuno without crashing
2. **UI Display**: Confirm the plugin window opens with title "SDRuno Plugin COSMO"
3. **Signal Detection**: 
   - Start streaming in SDRuno
   - Tune to a signal source
   - Verify LED changes from red to green when signal is present
4. **Settings Dialog**: Click settings button to ensure it doesn't crash
5. **Plugin Unload**: Use "Unload Plugin" in SDRuno to verify clean shutdown

## Compatibility
